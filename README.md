# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

the process to use git:
🔥 TL;DR（快速流程總結）

1️⃣ 每個人都從 main 創建自己的分支

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature-xxx
2️⃣ 開發 & 提交

git add .
git commit -m "你的變更描述"
3️⃣ 推送前先同步 main

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature-xxx
git rebase main
4️⃣ 推送功能分支

git push origin feature-xxx
5️⃣ GitHub 上創建 Pull Request (PR) 6️⃣ 審查通過後合併 PR，然後刪除功能分支

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature-xxx
git push origin --delete feature-xxx
7️⃣ 其他人只需要拉取 main

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature-xyz
git rebase main
